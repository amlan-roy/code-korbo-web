## Setting Up the Project

This is important and first step for contributing to project üòä

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) the Repository
- Clone Your Forked copy -<br>
  Open up the GitBash/Command Line/Terminal and type in
  `git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/code-korbo-web.git`

- Navigate to the directory of project -
  `cd code-korbo-web/`

- Create a new branch -
  `git checkout -b [branch_name]`

### Steps for setting up Frontend

- Setup the node modules -
  `npm i`

- Add a file named `.env.local` in the root of the directory and have the following in it -
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_JUDGE_0_X_RAPIDAPI_KEY=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_JUDGE_0_X_RAPDAPI_HOST=
  ```
- Input your own keys here and you're good to Go!!

### Steps for getting your API keys

You can get you api keys by following thesteps below. Add these API keys in `.env.local` to get started.

#### Firebase

Setup a firebase project and get the keys from there. [Steps for it](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object)

#### Judge0

- You can either get your Judge0 CE keys from Rapid API from [here](https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up?referral=/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce/pricing)
- Or you can use docker to [host it yourself](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#deployment-procedure)
  - In this case, remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_JUDGE_0_X_RAPIDAPI_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_JUDGE_0_X_RAPDAPI_HOST` from `.env.local`
  - Update `CODE_EXECUTION_DOMAIN` to point to the local domain for judge0 (eg: `http://localhost:2358/`)
  - Remove all instances of `judge_0_config`
